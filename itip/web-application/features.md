# Web Application Features
{: .no_toc }

The Web Application's capabilities, grouped by functional component. Each section is one component of the product; the entries under it are the capabilities it provides. ITIP is in active design.

Each capability carries the exact ITIP **SemVer milestone** that delivers it: **1.0** is the GA scope and **1.1**–**1.5** is the ordered post-GA roadmap — see **[Milestones & Versions]({% link milestones.md %})** for the canonical version semantics and the delivery clause.

## Published feature catalogue

The product's published features on [poesis.cloud](https://poesis.cloud/solutions/itip/products/web-application) map onto the functional components below:

| Published feature | Functional component(s) |

| IT artifact factory | [Deliverables](#deliverables) |
| GSM Definitions truth sourcing management | [Truth Sourcing](#truth-sourcing), [Review](#review) |
| IT compliance evaluation | [Evaluation](#evaluation) |
| IT Copilot | [Copilot](#copilot) |
| IT impact simulation | [Simulation](#simulation) |
| GSM Definitions management | [Definition](#definition), [Lenses](#lenses), [Overview](#overview) |
| GSM Ontology management | [Ontology](#ontology) |
| RBAC and ABAC | [Admin](#admin), role-specific [Usage Scenarios]({% link itip/web-application/usage-scenarios/index.md %}) |
