# SAF — the Systemic Agentic Framework

{: .no_toc }

The **Systemic Agentic Framework (SAF)** is a governed, local-first way to run **SAFe** with AI agents. Multi-agent orchestrations — portfolio, program, and iteration — run on your own machine inside your agent host (VS Code / GitHub Copilot today; the harness is host-agnostic), producing standard, schema-validated SAFe artifacts — Epics, Features, Stories, ADRs, kanbans, gate records — synchronized through your organization's own git host. A human ★ gate closes every layer: agents propose through evidence and sequence; the decision stays with you.

SAF complements **[ITIP]({% link itip/index.md %})** and integrates with **[SIE]({% link sie/index.md %})**: its artifact templates can be sourced as GSM Archetypes, and its agents can consume the organization's governed definitions as context while they work.

## The framework's architecture

Four properties make it work:

1. **Local-first** — the agent loop runs on each user's machine, in the IDE, against the real working tree. Sensitive information never leaves the machine; only the artifacts you commit sync out transparently to your organization's git host.
2. **Governed** — a portfolio → program → iteration hierarchy of role agents, with a human ★ gate at every layer. An org chart with human authority, not a flat swarm.
3. **Sovereign** — work state lives in your own files and git history (the event log), not a vendor's cloud. Nothing is trapped in an unmanaged session.
4. **Portable** — the harness is methodology- and host-agnostic: plain files, a stable CLI, host-specifics isolated behind a thin adapter. The same familiar agentic work method follows you from host to host — VS Code today, another IDE, CI runner, or agent host tomorrow — with no relearning.

Three orchestrators, one per SAFe layer, drive the model — dispatched from a single entry point, `@vmo-orchestrator`:

*Each orchestrator is an entry point carrying your use case for its layer, and **returns that layer's ★ gates to you**. The framework's only external link is the git host — Jira and Confluence sync from there. The full model is on the **[SAFe Agentic Organization]({% link saf/safe-agentic-organization/index.md %})** page.*
